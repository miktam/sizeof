### Get size of a JavaScript object in Bytes

JavaScript does not provide sizeof (like in C), and programmer does not need to care about memory allocation/deallocation. 

However, according to [ECMAScript Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/), each String value is represented by 16-bit unsigned integer, Number uses  the double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values including the special "Not-a-Number" (NaN) values, positive infinity, and negative infinity.

Having this knowledge, the module calculates how much memory object will allocate. 

### Limitations
Please note, that V8 which compiles the JavaScript into native machine code, is not taken into account, as the compiled code is additionally heavily optimized. 

### Installation

`npm install object-sizeof`

### Examples

```javascript
  var sizeof = require('object-sizeof');
  
  // 2B per character, 6 chars total => 12B
  console.log(sizeof({abc: 'def'}));
  
  // 8B for Number => 8B
  console.log(sizeof(12345));
  
  var param = { 
    'a': 1, 
    'b': 2, 
    'c': {
      'd': 4
    }
  };
  // 4 one two-bytes char strings and 3 eighth-bytes numbers => 32B
  console.log(sizeof(param));

```
